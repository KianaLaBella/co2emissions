# Top 10 CO2 Emitters Over 50 Years
This code will analyze the top 10 countries with the most CO2 emissions and their developments over 50 years (1971-2020).
I will be using the data from *Our World in Data* (https://github.com/owid/co2-data) in order to complete this lab. I downloaded it from the link entitled owid-co2-data.csv on March 29, 2023.

## Requirements

I will be using the CoLab software, created by Google, to code with Python for this project. In it, I have imported the following softwares: Pandas, Numpy, Mathplotlib.Pyplot, Seaborn, and Missingno. Pandas is being used to effectively analyze, manipulate, and clean up data throughout the code. Numpy provides the code with multiple mathmatical operations to use on the data. Mathplotlib.Pyplot allows me to plot any data or equation and make changes to the plot's figure is necessary. Seaborn creates easily-readable graphs to assist with statistical analysis. Finally, Missingno is used to visualize the data to better check for its completeness.

## Data

The data used in this lab is from *Our World in Data* (https://github.com/owid/co2-data). It is a recording of all Greenhouse Gas and CO2 Emissions in the world, organized by country, continent, and world. It is updated regularly, as needed, and keeps a well-rounded collection of each country's contributon to harmful emissions in the atmosphere. It also organizes the emissions by their source. For example,

## Author

This lab was done by Kiana LaBella, a Civil Engineering student at Seattle University. She is also pursuing minors in Mathematics and Writing Studies. She hopes that the data analysis depicted in this repository will be useful for understanding how different countries contribute to excessive CO2 emissions in the atmosphere.
