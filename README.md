# Top 10 CO2 Emitters Over 50 Years
This code will analyze the top 10 countries with the most CO2 emissions and their developments over 50 years (1971-2020).
I will be using the data from Our World in Data (https://github.com/owid/co2-data) in order to complete this lab. I downloaded it from the link entitled owid-co2-data.csv on March 29, 2023.
